# Contributing to DisasterMesh

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DisasterMesh! This project aims to provide reliable emergency communication tools, and we welcome contributions from developers who share this mission.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Search existing issues** before creating a new one
- **Use clear, descriptive titles** for bug reports and feature requests
- **Include steps to reproduce** for bug reports
- **Provide device/OS information** when relevant
- **Add screenshots or logs** when helpful

### Suggesting Features
- **Check if the feature already exists** or is planned
- **Explain the use case** and why it would be valuable
- **Consider emergency scenarios** and how the feature helps
- **Think about offline functionality** and resource constraints

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
4. **Set up the development environment** (see README.md)

#### Development Guidelines

##### Code Style
- **Follow Kotlin conventions** and Android best practices
- **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
- **Add KDoc comments** for public APIs
- **Keep functions small** and focused on single responsibilities
- **Use consistent indentation** (4 spaces)

##### Architecture
- **Follow MVVM pattern** where applicable
- **Use Android Architecture Components** (ViewModel, LiveData, etc.)
- **Separate concerns** between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Handle configuration changes** properly
- **Consider battery optimization** and performance

##### Emergency-Focused Development
- **Prioritize reliability** over fancy features
- **Design for stress situations** - simple, clear interfaces
- **Test offline scenarios** thoroughly
- **Consider accessibility** for users with disabilities
- **Optimize for low-battery situations**

##### Security Considerations
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, certificates)
- **Use secure communication** protocols
- **Validate all user inputs**
- **Follow Android security best practices**
- **Consider privacy implications** of location data

#### Testing
- **Write unit tests** for new functionality
- **Test on multiple devices** and Android versions
- **Test offline scenarios** and edge cases
- **Verify accessibility** with TalkBack and other tools
- **Test in low-battery conditions**

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Add tests** for new features
3. **Ensure all tests pass**
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Create a clear PR description** explaining the changes
