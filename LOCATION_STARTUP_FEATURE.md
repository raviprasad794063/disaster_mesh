# üìç Current Location on Startup Feature

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

The app now automatically centers the map on the user's current location when it starts up, providing a much better user experience for emergency situations where knowing your exact location is critical.

## ‚ú® **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Automatic Location Detection**
- **On app startup**, the map automatically attempts to get the user's current location
- **Fallback system** with multiple attempts to ensure location is found
- **Default location** (San Francisco) used if location services are unavailable

### 2. **Smart Location Handling**
- **Last known location** is tried first for faster response
- **Fresh location request** if last known location is unavailable
- **Timeout mechanism** (30 seconds) to prevent indefinite waiting
- **Permission-aware** - handles cases where location permission is denied

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- **Current location marker** added to the map showing "You are here"
- **Success notifications** when location is found and map is centered
- **Helpful messages** when using default location with option to enable location services
- **Custom location icon** with app theme colors

### 4. **User Controls**
- **Location FAB** (Floating Action Button) to manually refresh current location
- **Automatic refresh** when location permissions are granted
- **Easy access** to re-center on current location anytime

## üîß **Technical Implementation**
