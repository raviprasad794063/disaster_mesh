# Security Policy

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of DisasterMesh with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT**: For emergency communication software, security vulnerabilities can have serious real-world consequences. We take security reports very seriously.

### How to Report

**For non-critical vulnerabilities:**
- Create a private security advisory on GitHub
- Email: security@disastermesh.org (if available)
- Include detailed steps to reproduce
- Provide impact assessment

**For critical vulnerabilities:**
- Email immediately with "CRITICAL SECURITY" in subject
- Do not create public issues for critical vulnerabilities
- We will respond within 24 hours for critical issues

### What to Include

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** on users and emergency scenarios
4. **Suggested fix** if you have one
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24 hours response, 7 days fix target
- **High severity**: 72 hours response, 30 days fix target
- **Medium/Low severity**: 1 week response, 90 days fix target

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Emergency Context
DisasterMesh operates in emergency scenarios where:
- **Lives may depend** on reliable communication
- **Infrastructure may be compromised**
- **Users may be under stress** and make mistakes
- **Devices may have limited power** and connectivity

### Security Priorities

1. **Data Integrity** - Ensure messages are not corrupted
2. **Availability** - Keep the service running during emergencies
3. **Privacy** - Protect user location and communication data
4. **Authentication** - Verify admin/authority roles properly
5. **Resilience** - Resist attacks that could disable the network

### Known Security Considerations

#### Location Privacy
- Location data is processed locally when possible
- Admin broadcasts include location information
- Users should be aware of location sharing implications

#### Network Security
- Mesh network uses Google Nearby Connections API
- Communications are encrypted by the underlying API
- Network discovery is limited to nearby devices

#### Role-Based Access
- Admin password is currently hardcoded (see Security Improvements)
- Role switching requires password verification
- Admin privileges allow network-wide broadcasts

## 🔧 Security Improvements Needed

### High Priority
- [ ] **Implement secure admin authentication** (replace hardcoded password)
- [ ] **Add message signing** for admin broadcasts
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting** for alert broadcasts
- [ ] **Add audit logging** for admin actions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Encrypt local data storage** for sensitive information
- [ ] **Implement user verification** for SOS signals
- [ ] **Add network abuse detection**
- [ ] **Secure backup/restore** functionality

### Low Priority
- [ ] **End-to-end encryption** for peer communications
- [ ] **Advanced authentication** methods (biometric, etc.)
- [ ] **Network topology obfuscation**

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Do This
- ❌ Store sensitive data in plain text
- ❌ Trust user input without validation
- ❌ Ignore certificate validation errors
- ❌ Use deprecated cryptographic methods
- ❌ Log sensitive information
- ❌ Hardcode secrets in source code

### Do This Instead
- ✅ Use Android Keystore for sensitive data
- ✅ Validate and sanitize all inputs
- ✅ Implement proper certificate pinning
- ✅ Use current cryptographic standards
- ✅ Log only necessary, non-sensitive information
- ✅ Use secure configuration management

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **Static analysis** with Android lint and security scanners
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Code review** for security issues

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration testing** of network protocols
- **Privacy analysis** of data handling
- **Authentication bypass** attempts
- **Input validation** testing

### Emergency Scenario Testing
- **Stress testing** under high load
- **Reliability testing** with network failures
- **Battery drain** security implications
- **Device compromise** scenarios
